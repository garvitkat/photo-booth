## About The Project

In an age of fleeting digital images, Retro Snaps brings back the charm and nostalgia of classic instant photography. This web application allows you to create your own virtual Polaroids with a unique twist.

With a single click, the application captures a quick burst of three photos, mimicking the candid and often surprising nature of old-school instant cameras. You can then add your own personal touch with a handwritten message or a doodle before saving the final Polaroid to your personal gallery.

Itâ€™s all about capturing moments, imperfections and all, and turning them into lasting memories.

### Key Features:

  * **Three-Shot Burst:** One click captures three quick frames, giving your Polaroid a unique, dynamic feel.
  * **Handwritten Text:** Use your mouse or touchscreen to write a personal note on the Polaroid's frame.
  * **Virtual Gallery:** Save your creations to a personal gallery to view and share later.
  * **Authentic Aesthetic:** From the photo development animation to the classic frame, every detail is designed to feel retro.
